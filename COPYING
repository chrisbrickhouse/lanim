== Summary ==
To ensure the greatest possible range of re-use, the author offers and automatically grants you multiple simultaneous licenses. You may choose any one license, or a combination of licenses, as appropriate for the needs of your project. Simply distribute the software with whichever license files you would like to be granted. For example, if you would like to be granted ONLY the Creative Commons By-SA 4.0 license, delete all LICENSE files except LICENSE.CC4 when you distribute the repository.

The simplest solution is to distribute the content as-is, and if you make modifications, to offer your contributions under the same constellation of licenses by adding your name to the copyright statement above.
