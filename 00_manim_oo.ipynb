    "Manim is a *programatic* animation software which separates it from other animation software you might be familiar with. A common way to make animations is using PowerPoint or LibreOffice Present where text or images are placed on the slide and you can select options for how they should move, fade in, rotate, and transform. This kind of *graphical* animation software shows you the objects you are working with, how they are aranged. It allows you to move them around with your mouse and select animations from a toolbar or contextual menu. Manim, by contrast, is *programatic* in the sense that animations are created by writing source code which you render later. Instead of creating a circle by clicking a tool and drawing it to be the size you want, in Manim you define a circle with particular parameters like `Circle(radius=2)` which creates a circle with a radius of 2 units. To animate the circle, you transform that circle *object* using functions. At the end, you render the circle and *then* you get to see how the animation looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This probably sounds more complicated than just making some slides and animating the text and drawings there, and you'd be right! Manim gives you fine-grained control over your drawings and animations, but this creative freedom translates to a complex and powerful tool. For simple animations, other software will probably be sufficient, and you should consider the trade-offs when choosing an animation software. All that said, Manim allows you to create engaging and professional-looking visualizations and with some time and dedication, you will be able to make compelling animations in an afternoon!\n",

    "If you've done some programming you might have heard of **object-oriented programming** (OOP). A full description is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but what is important to understand is that OOP is a paradigm which focuses on *object* and how to manipulate them, rather than the functions and logic underlying the object. To illustrate the difference between OOP and functional programming, let's consider an example.\n",

But as the term goes on, you realize that your information needs to be updated. David is graduating early. Billy changed his major to Biology. A student comes out to you as non-binary and wants to be referred to as A Abstract instead of their former name (you should probably also add a field for pronouns too). You don't want to have to go in and edit the whole dictionary by hand, so how do you update the dictioanry programmatically? One common solution might look like the following code."

In Python, objects usually take the form of a **class**, and below we have an example class, `Student`, which we can use to represent students enrolled in our class."

    "### Major principles in OOP (Patterns)\n",
    "The example given above illustrates a number of principles which will be helpful to keep in mind when working with Manim, structuring your code, and manipulating objects. In software programming, similar problems arise all the time, and certain solutions have shown to be better than others. These solutions are called **patterns** and they articulate principles of good software design. Patterns contrast with **anti-patterns** which are attractive solutions (like our dictionary roster) which ultimately cause more problems later on. In this section we explore some OOP principles and design patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction** focuses on abstracting the *implementation* of a function from the *interface* of the function. For example, a `Student.change_name()` is a function which changes the `Student.name` attribute. How it does this is unimportant, and in fact, we can change it at any time. By creating a function instead of changing the attribute directly, we have created a level of abstraction. We can now call `Student.change_name()` and *always* know that no matter what, the student's name will be changed---we can change names without needing to worry about *how* to change names. \n",
    "* **Encapsulation** is a design pattern which focuses on keeping objects self-contained. Each object should have everything it needs to work inside of it already, and things outside the object (users, programs, other objects) should only ever interact with the object through well defined and predictable methods. Changing the name of one student-object should not affect the others, for example. By encapsulating objects, we prevent unintended or unknown data corruption and make debugging easier by limiting how parts of a program are allowed to interact.\n",
    "* **Inheritance** represents hierarchical relationships between objects. For example, all students are people, but not all people are students. We could have `class Person(object)` which has attributes and functions for names and pronouns, but not major or graduation year. Instead of rewriting all that code for students, we could *inherit* the features of the `Person` class and then *extend* student-specific features in this new class. This is used frequently in Manim and will turn out to be quite powerful. "
