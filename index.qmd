Manim is a python library primarily used to make mathematics animiations for educational YouTube videos. In this tutorial we will explore how this software can be used to create engaging visualizations of linguistic data and learn the basic building blocks of the animation software. 

## Learning goals
By the end of this readers will 
* develop a basic understanding of object-oriented programming
* understand the basic building blocks of Manim
* be able to create visualizations for explaining linguistic concepts
* produce animated plots of phonetic data

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that learners already have the following knowledge about Python:
* the difference between the following types and how to manipulate them: strings, integers, floats, lists, and dictionaries
* how to write and use custom functions
* the basics of classes, specifically:
** how to define a class
** the `__init__` method
** class attributes and methodsattributes, and the relationship between functions and methods

Additionally, learners should be comfortable navigating through folders in the terminal and running programs from the command line. 

## Overview
This tutorial is divided into <TK> parts.
1. This introduction
2. An introduction to the basics of Manim and object-oriented programming more generally
3. A worked example of <TK> which brings together concepts learned in the previous section
4. An introduction to axes, plotting, and fine-grained control of animations
5. A worked example of plotting and animating vowel data from a change-over-time
6. Advice on advanced features and further reading
